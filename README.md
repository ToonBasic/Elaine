# Elaine
Elaine is a multi-version compatible prediction-based Anti-Cheat. It's meant to be a starting ground for aspiring Anti-Cheat developers who are looking to better understand Anti-Cheats and client functionality.

# Requirements
Elaine is built upon ProtocolLib to support multiple server versions. There is plans on adding a custom Packet API in the near future, though I find it unnecessary for right now.

# Incompatibilities
There are no known incompatbilities with Elaine as of right now.

You're welcome to come assist in the development of Elaine by finding false flags here:
